Create a Python program to compute the sum of the first N natural numbers {1,2,3...N}. The program should prompt the user to input the value of N, then compute and print the sum of the first N natural numbers.
n=int(input()) # formula to find sum of n numbers:  Sn=n(n+1)/2  
sum=n*(n+1)//2 #// is used to remove the floating value
print(sum)
