Create a Python program to determine the nth element of an arithmetic sequence where the first term a is 7 and the common difference d is 11. The program should prompt the user to input the value of n, then compute and print the nth element of the sequence.
my code:
a=7
b=11
user_input=int(input())
nth_element=a+(user_input-1)*d       # the formula for the arthematic sequence is An=A1+(n-1)*d   d=diffrence
print(nth_element)
